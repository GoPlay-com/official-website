                </p>
                <h5>SECTION 5 - PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (if applicable)</h5>
                <p>
                  Certain products or services may be available exclusively
                  online through the website. These products or services may
                  have limited quantities and are subject to return or exchange
                  only according to our Return Policy. We have made every effort
                  to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of
                  our products that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee
                  that your computer monitor's display of any color will be
                  accurate. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to
                  limit the sales of our products or Services to any person,
                  geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right
                  on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the
                  quantities of any products or services that we offer. All
                  descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to
                  change at anytime without notice, at the sole discretion of
                  us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any
                  time. Any offer for any product or service made on this site
                  is void where prohibited. We do not warrant that the quality
                  of any products, services, information, or other material
                  purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or
                  that any errors in the Service will be corrected.
                </p>
                <h5>SECTION 6 - ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We
                  may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities
                  purchased per person, per household or per order. These
                  restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same
                  customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
                  the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we
                  make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify
                  you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone
                  number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the
                  right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment,
                  appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors. You
                  agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and
                  account information for all purchases made at our store. You
                  agree to promptly update your account and other information,
                  including your email address and credit card numbers and
                  expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions
                  and contact you as needed. Once a transaction has been
                  complete and you have paid for the service or prodcut, no
                  refunds will be given for any reason.
                </p>
                <h5>SECTION 7 - CANCELLATION POLICY</h5>

                  If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (for
                  example contest entries) or without a request from us you send
                  creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other

                  affect the operation of the Service or any related website.
                  You may not use a false e-mail address, pretend to be someone
                  other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or third-parties
                  as to the origin of any comments. You are solely responsible
                  for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no
                  responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted

                </h5>
                <p>
                  We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our
                  service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free.
                  We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from
                  the use of the service will be accurate or reliable. You agree
                  that from time to time we may remove the service for
                  indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at any time,
                  without notice to you. You expressly agree that your use of,
                  or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The
                  service and all products and services delivered to you through
                  the service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided
                  'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any
                  representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either
                  express or implied, including all implied warranties or
                  conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness
                  for a particular purpose, durability, title, and
                  non-infringement. In no case shall GoPlay, our directors,
                  officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns,
                  suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any
                  injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental,
                  punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind,
                  including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost
                  savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar
                  damages, whether based in contract, tort (including
                  negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your
                  use of any of the service or any products procured using the
                  service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use
                  of the service or any product, including, but not limited to,
                  any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage
                  of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or
                  any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise
                  made available via the service, even if advised of their
                  possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow
                  the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential
                  or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our
                  liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by
                  law.

                  determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such
                  provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest
                  extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable
                  portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of
                  Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and
                  enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

                  The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or
